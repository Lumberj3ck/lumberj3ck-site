Hi there! I'm Alan, a software engineering student with a knack for building things and a burning passion for innovative tech. This website is a product of my current dive into the world of **Go**. As I explore this language, I wanted to create a space to track my own progress, share my learnings, and hopefully, benefit other Go enthusiasts just like me on their own journeys.
 

I'm not just a learner â€“ I'm a doer, absolutely buzzing with ideas! I've explored **Python**, **Javascript**. I'm currently working on customizeable *Valentine postcard website* and I've also built a couple of other project and continue maintain those.  Want more details on that? Check the [link](https://www.postcard-gift.site/). 

You won't find me sitting still. I thrive on challenges, whether it's wrestling with code or pushing my limits at the gym. When I'm not building software, I'm probably blasting some Linkin Park to match my energy!  

If you've got any questions, suggestions, or would like to discuss a project then please email me or get in touch on any of the platforms below. I'd be happy to hear from you.
