This **tutorial** is written for anyone who is new to Go. In it we'll explain what packages, import statements and modules are in Go, how they work and relate to each other and — hopefully — clear up any questions that you have. We'll start at a high level, then work down to the details later.


Once imported, *the package name* becomes an accessor for the contents of that package. Conveniently, all the packages in the Go standard library have a package name which is the same as the final element of their import path.


{{< highlight python "linenos=table,hl_lines=,linenostart=1" >}}
# File main.py

import math

def sum(a: int, b :int) -> int:
    return a + b
{{< / highlight >}}
