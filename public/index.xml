      <description>Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Alan, a software engineering student with a knack for building things and a burning passion for innovative tech. This website is a product of my current dive into the world of Go. As I explore this language, I wanted to create a space to track my own progress, share my learnings, and hopefully, benefit other Go enthusiasts just like me on their own journeys.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not just a learner â€“ I&amp;rsquo;m a doer, absolutely buzzing with ideas!</description>
